    NFA-λtoDFA - README


    DEPENDENCIES
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~
    pydot
        Read and write DOT files.
    NetworkX
        Convenient and powerful graph representation.


    INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    NFA-λtoDFA <input file> <output file>


    INPUT FILE
    ~~~~~~~~~~
    At present, it only supports DOT (graphviz) files.
    UTF-8 and ASCII encodings work, others might too.
    The start node requires a 'start' attribute and final nodes require a
    'final' attribute, with any value.


    FEATURES/LIMITATIONS
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    It requires an exact separator string between edge symbols.  You can set
    the separator string to whatever you want, but you must abide by it when
    specifying edge labels in the input file.  See the example files provided.

    Arbitrary data/attributes are not supported.

    It appears that pydot does not support HTML labels, so neither does this
    script.

    I only have Python 2 packages for NetworkX and pydot, so it is untested
    with Python 3.


    CONFIGURATION
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    There are some global variables at the top of the source code that will
    one day probably go into a configuration file, but for now you'll have to
    edit them there.
